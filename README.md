## Your Handy Weather App

This is my first project ever since I embarked on this journey as a self-taught software developer in 2022. This application is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, integrating <a href="https://openweathermap.org/">OpenWeather API</a> and axios to fetch weather data.

I was inspired by the design of the Macbook browser and wanted to integrate the look and feel in my application. This is shown through the "window" with the classic 3 coloured dots, the use of black and different shades of grey for font colours, and placement of the items.

Main features:
- Displays the weather for today and forecast for the next 6 days based on the city of your choice
- Clicking the "pin" icon beside the search bar will allow the site to access your current location and display the weather information
- Toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit to view the temperature
- Weather application is draggable, just like a "browser window"
