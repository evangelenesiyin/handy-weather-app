## 🌤️ Your Handy Weather App

The weather dashboard is my one of my first projects ever since I embarked on this journey as a self-taught software developer in 2022. I was inspired by the design of the Macbook browser and wanted to integrate the look and feel in the dashboard. This project allowed me to be creative in designing and I learnt a lot about CSS as I turned my design into life.

## ⛄️ Features
- ☀️ Displays the weather for today and forecast for the next 6 days based on the city of your choice<br /> <i>[Update: Forecast feature is no longer available due to the discontinuation of OpenWeatherMap's One Call API 2.5 in June 2024. Its new API 3.0 will be chargeable and therefore I have decided to leave out this feature in the project. The code will still be left untouched. Please refer to the demo image and video to see how the forecast looks like.]</i>
- ☁️ Option to access your current location and display the weather accordingly
- 🌧️ Toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit to view the temperature
- 🌩️ Draggable dashboard, just like a "browser window"
