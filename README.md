## 🌤️ Your Handy Weather App

The weather dashboard is my one of my first projects ever since I embarked on this journey as a self-taught software developer in 2022. I was inspired by the design of the Macbook browser and wanted to integrate the look and feel in the dashboard. This project allowed me to be creative in designing and I learnt a lot about CSS as I turned my design into life.
