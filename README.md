## Your Handy Weather App

This is my first project ever since I embarked on this journey as a self-taught frontend developer in 2022. This application is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, integrating <a href="https://openweathermap.org/">OpenWeather API</a> and axios to fetch weather data.

In terms of design, I was inspired by how clean the Mac user interface is and wanted to integrate that look and feel in my application. This was shown with the "window" with the classic 3 coloured dots, the use of black and different shades of grey for font colours, and placement of the items.
